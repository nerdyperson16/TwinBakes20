            My name is Kenneth Rivera Bustamante, <br />
            I enjoyed making food for my boys and tried making some No-Bake Cheesecake. At first, I made a No-Bake Blueberry Cheesecake and I even shared it to my nieces and nephews. Afterwards, I made pastas and more. <br />
            I even made No-Bake cheesecakes like Mixed Berries, Ferrero Cheesecake, Mango Cheesecake, Oreo Cheesecake with Walnuts, and Oreo Cheesecake with Nutella. <br />
            Last September 2018 as a banker, I decided to resign and focus on my twin boys. I continued to bake using my only toaster and I tried making other treats like homemade pretzel, Keto Peanut Butter Cookies, Choco-Chip Cookies, Brownies, and a lot more. <br />
            On October 2018, I bought a convection oven. I tried making homemade Pizza from scratch. <br />
            One morning, I remember enjoying to eat homemade Banana Bread from my friend. And I started searching for a recipe so I can make it for my own. On December 2018, I made the perfect Banana Bread and shared it a friend and she loved it. I even tried exploring something new for her Banana Bread recipe. Remembering that she had family members who are Diabetic, I researched for an ingredient to make her Banana Bread safe for older people, health conscious, and diabetic. <br />
            I started making Banana Bread for my family and some friends. Sometimes, I visited my work and shared my Banana Bread and everyone loved it. <br />
            One day, a family friend of mine asked ‚Äúhow much?‚Äù. I refused and said that I don‚Äôt sell it since I baked it only for personal and family consumption. But my family friend insisted that I should give her a price so she can buy some. <br />
            And from all of that started my baking business to what it is today. Welcome to Twin Bakes!
